Lab 2 - d3
Ann Fritz, GEOG 575 Fall 2019

originalD3index.html and originalMain.js are the files for the lab exercises for Lab 2; note that the 
index.html and main.js are for the lab that contains my original data. The originalmain.js does not completely work, there are a few
debugging steps needed yet to get the charts to work correctly.  Dont' have time to do it now, however, as I need to get working on 
my lab data.

Conceptual model for lab 2 is for map of US and chart of 10 years of state's oil production numbers (in thousand barrells).
The user can select a state and see the oil production numbers for 10 years for that state in the chart, to
see if production has increased or decreased over the last 10 years. 

Additional concept is to make an interactive version of the Infographic created for GEOG 572, comparing the ratio of spill
response staff to oil spills occuring in a state in a single year (2018).  However, I may not have the time or skills developed to do
that visualization within the time allowed for the lab.  So I"m sticking to the oil production numbers as a start...

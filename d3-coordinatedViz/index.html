            <h1>Ten Years of US Oil Production and Spill Response</h1>
            <p>Oil production and a snapshot of number of staff listed as "spill response" and amount of oil produced in 2017.  I've always wanted to expand the story from my longform infographic created in GEOG572 and make it more exploratory. That infographic explored the number of staff that respond to oil spills to the barrels of oil produced in a state. I thought it would be interesting to see how the top producing states may have fluctuated over time. Oil production numbers are from the Energy Information Agency from 2008-2017. Number of staff and number of spills is difficult to assess on a state by state basis. I've found that many states divide response duties among various agencies, depending on where the spill occurs (coastal areas or on state or federal land, for example).  States environmental agencies typically do not list the how many people are in a spill response team so it was difficult to evaluate how many staff are available to respond to oil spills. Some states did not even list oil spills, rather they have only a spill reporting website.</p>

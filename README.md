began as lab2 module 2 for Geography 575 UW-Madison Fall 2019, but morphed into the Lab 2 assignment.

I've always wanted to expand the data from my longform infographic created in GEOG572 and make it more exploratory.  That infographic explored the number of staff that respond to oil spills to the barrels of oil produced in a state.  The infographic iss static, but i thought it would be interesting to see how the top producing states may have fluctuated over time. Oil production was fairly easy number to get from the Energy Information Agency (eia.gov) from 2008-2017. Number of staff and number of spills is difficult to assess on a state by state basis.  I've found that many states divide response duties among various agencies, depending on where the spill occurs (coastal areas or on state or federal land, for example) and they do not list the names or any indication of how many people are on staff so it was difficult to evaluate how many staff are available to respond to oil spills.  Some states did not even list oil spills, rather they just have a reporting website.
